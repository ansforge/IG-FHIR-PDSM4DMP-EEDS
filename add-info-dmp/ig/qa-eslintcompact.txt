It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '20241213120000', found versions: 1.2.0, 1.3.0, 20241213120000. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'https://mos.esante.gouv.fr/NOS/JDV_J03-XdsContentTypeCode-CISIS/FHIR/JDV-J03-XdsContentTypeCode-CISIS' to 'https://mos.esante.gouv.fr/NOS/JDV_J03-XdsContentTypeCode-CISIS/FHIR/JDV-J03-XdsContentTypeCode-CISIS|20241213120000' (INVALID)
